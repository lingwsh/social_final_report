[Link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) <br>The dataset includes government hotlines' records from 2010 to the present, about a decade, covering all aspects of residents' daily life.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "New yorkers can complain by visiting NYC's online customer service, text messages, phone calls, skype, etc.NYC 311 dataset covers all aspects of citizen's life in New York, which can be roughly divided into the following categories: Benefit& Support, Business& Consumers, Courts& Law, Culture& Recreation, Education, Employment, Environment, Garbage& Recycling, Government& Elections, Health, Housing& Buildings, Noise, Pets,Pests& Wildlife, Public safety, Records, Sidewalks,Streets& highways, Taxes, Transportation.\n",

    "NYC311's mission is to provide the public with fast, convenient city government services and information, while providing the best customer service. It also helps organizations improve the services they offer, allowing them to focus on their core tasks and manage their workloads effectively. Meanwhile, NYC 311also provides insights into improving city government through accurate and consistent measurement and analysis of service delivery.\n",

    "However, it was impossible for us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of this incredible hugh dataset, so after preliminary statistics, we chose the category with the most cumulative complaints over the past decade: Noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>First of all, when it comes to environmental pollution, people may first think of air, soil, water and other aspects, but noise pollution, as an invisible and intangible existence, has the same impact on us that cannot be ignored.As a serious \"urban disease\", noise pollution has increasingly become the focus of modern urban life. New York, as a prosperous international city, also has such problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Moreover, We want to study the noise complaints in New York and analyze them from both spatial perspective and temporal perspective. We hope to learn something about the urban conditions, economic development, residents' living conditions and traffic conditions, etc, in the five boroughs of New York through the noise complaints. Moreover, we wonder whether noise complaints can be used to describe the overall development and brief condition of New York City over a 10-year period."
